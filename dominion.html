		<p>A game of Dominion in progress</p>
	</div>
	<p>Dominion is a board game by Donald X. Vaccarino in which players build a deck of cards in order to score points during their turns and end the game. I started playing casually in the early 2010s and then more competitively online after starting college, using the username 'tracer' after the alter ego in Calvin and Hobbes. Currently I am a frequent organizer of and participant in online tournaments, and also playtest upcoming expnsions.</p>
	<p>More information about the game can be found at <a href="https://www.riograndegames.com/games/dominion/">Rio Grande Games</a> and the base game is free to play at <a href="https://dominion.games/">dominion.games</a></p>
