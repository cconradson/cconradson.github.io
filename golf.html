	<p>I have played golf since before I started grade school, and enjoy both the landscapes I walk through while playing and the unique challenges it provides. Each shot requires mentally making a plan and then being able to physically execute on it, and golf is at its most fun for me when a course requires a large variety of plans to make.</p>

	<p>This map shows the golf courses I have played at.</p>

	<ul class="blank">
		<li><img class="inline" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/mapicons/grey.png" alt="grey"> Defunct - Courses that are no longer operational; they are listed with the group they would be in otherwise.</li>
		<li><img class="inline" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/mapicons/brown.png" alt="brown"> Outside of memory - I have played these but do not remember much of them due to time passage.</li>
		<li><img class="inline" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/mapicons/red.png" alt="red"> Avoid - Courses I would decline to return to</li>
		<li><img class="inline" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/mapicons/yellow.png" alt="yellow"> Acceptable - Good for variety but nothing making me to want to go there specifically</li>
		<li><img class="inline" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/mapicons/lightgreen.png" alt="light green"> Good - Come to mind as first options when deciding where to play</li>
		<li><img class="inline" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/mapicons/darkgreen.png" alt="dark green"> Great - Can be identified as memorable while playing</li>
		<li><img class="inline" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/mapicons/blue.png" alt="blue"> Outstanding - Courses to talk about as going somewhere to play them</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Clicking the <img class="inline" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/mapicons/expand.png" alt="expand"> icon in the upper left-hand corner of the map below will provide a list broken down by category.
