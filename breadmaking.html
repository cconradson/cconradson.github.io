		<p>Loaf from May 17, 2020</p>
	</div>
	<p>After becoming dissatisfied with product quality from local bakeries in late 2019, I decided to make the only person I could complain to about bread quality myself. With some online research to start and a lot of trial and error since, I have now been baking close to daily since late December of that year.</p>

	<h3>Yeast</h3>
	<img class="toright" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/starter.jpg" alt="starter">
	<p>I use yeast from a starter (pictured at right).</p>
	<p>Twice a day the yeast gets fed by taking by weight 1 part starter, 1 part water, and 1 part flour, and mixing them then leaving at room temperature. Excess yeast is used or discarded. For yeast feeding I use a blend that is roughly 1/4 whole barley flour and 3/4 bread flour.</p>
	<p>Creating the starter was much the same as maintaining it - the first day just didn't have the 1 part starter in the feeding mixture. It took close to 2 weeks before the yeast started being effective for baking.</p>

	<h3>Procedure for Bread</h3>
	<p>I typically aim for baking in the morning, which means starting in the later part of the day 2 days before the bake. The sequence on the start day takes slightly under 6 hours, baking is roughly an hour and a half total.</p>
	<p>My target mass for a loaf is in the 510-530 g range (roughly 1.15 pounds). With the tools I have this ideally comes from a loaf that is roughly 23 cm by 16 cm (rounded ends) with a height around 9 cm.</p>
	<h4>Mixing</h4>
	<p>One loaf at the desired size takes 320 g flour, 270 g water, 1/4 cup starter, 1 tsp salt. I use a blend of 60% all-purpose flour and 40% bread flour. Bread flour is higher in protein which leads to more structure at the expense of texture - the bread is less soft.</p>
	<p>Start by mixing the flour and the water and let that rest for around 45 minutes. After that, mix in the starter and salt - the dough should become difficult to mix fairly quickly after starting to do this, but try to distribute the starter as well as possible while still being gentle.<br>From here, cover the bowl being used with a damp towel and try to place in an environment about 29 degrees Celsius (roughly 85 F). A warmer enviorment at this stage leads to more flavor in the bread, though having it too warm can lead to structural problems.</p>
	<h4>Working<h4>
	<p>Most guides say to let the bulk rise (what happens in the warm environment after mixing) until the dough has doubled or slightly more in size. In reality, this is incredibly difficult to judge since the dough changes shape as well as size. I instead have trial-and-errored to a time of roughly 3 hours 20 minutes when at 29 C. Too long and the yeast expends its food supply and does little in the oven, too short and there isn't enough protein chaining for proper structure.</p>
	<p>At this point lightly flour a bread board and empty the dough onto it. Lightly fold the dough over on itself a number of times - this helps to distribute yeast into places where it can feed once again. A scraper of some sort is useful both for removing from the bowl and for moving the dough off of the board.</p>
	<p>Afterwards, place the dough back in the bowl, re-cover it, and place it back in the warm environment. Letting the dough rest in this time allows the yeast to feed in its new location in the dough. Currently I do the folding process 3 times, spaced by about 30 minutes each. By the end of the last, the dough rebounds slightly to its original shape when disturbed.</p>
	<p>I shape by folding the dough in half and letting it elongate in my hands holding the fold together. Once it fits, I place it in a basket with a lightly floured cloth, then put it in a refrigerator to proof. Proofing cold helps both with maintaining structure and with flavor.</p>
	<h4>Baking<h4>
	<p>The second morning after mixing, it is time to bake. I preheat my oven to 525 Fahrenheit (274 C) - ideal temperature likely varies significantly across ovens and cooking vessels used. For good crust, baking should start in a vessel that can hold in steam and withstand the high oven temperatures, such as a Dutch oven. I also place a baking stone on the bottom shelf to prevent direct heat from reaching the bottom of the vessel as to not burn the bottom of the bread. </p>
	<p>Once the oven has heated, prepare a piece of parchment paper with a thin layer of flour over an area roughly the size of the basket used for proofing. Empty the dough from the basket onto that flour by inverting the basket - the dough should fall off the cloth cleanly. Score (make cuts in) the top as desired. I usually make 2 overlapping cuts running roughly 2/3 the length down the middle.<br>Now the dough is movable via the parchment paper - lower it into the vessel, cover, and place in the oven.</p>
	<p>After 20 minutes or a bit more, remove the cover and slightly after that after reclosing the oven, lower the temperature of the oven (for me to 450 F (232 C)).<br>About 20 minutes after this, move the bread out of the vessel and onto a cool pan (I use an airbake) and place back in the oven.<br>About 20 minutes after that, the bread will be finished. Some ovens bake unevenly front-to-back - if this is the case, it may be worth rotating the pan halfway through on this last step.</p>
	<p>The bread needs to cool some (at least an hour, longer better) before cutting to finish baking. Before cooled, the inside will be gummy and most of the taste sensation will be that it is warm. This is actually a good thing for mediocre bread, but good bread will still be good when cooled.</p>
