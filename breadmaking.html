	<p>After becoming dissatisfied with product quality from local bakeries in late 2019, I decided to make the only person I could complain to about bread quality myself. With some online research to start and a lot of trial and error since, I have now been baking close to daily since late December of that year.</p>

	<h4>Yeast</h4>
	<img class="toright" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/starter.jpg" alt="starter">
	<p>I use yeast from a starter (pictured at right).</p>
	<p>Twice a day the yeast gets fed by taking by weight 1 part starter, 1 part water, and 1 part flour, and mixing them then leaving at room temperature. Excess yeast is used or discarded. For yeast feeding I use a blend that is roughly 1/4 whole barley flour and 3/4 bread flour.</p>
	<p>Creating the starter was much the same as maintaining it - the first day just didn't have the 1 part starter in the feeding mixture. It took close to 2 weeks before the yeast started being effective for baking.</p>

	<p>This will have the bread procedure but I mostly want something here to figure out the float clearing for now</p>
