	<p>After becoming dissatisfied with product quality from local bakeries in late 2019, I decided to make the only person I could complain to about bread quality myself. With some online research to start and a lot of trial and error since, I have now been baking close to daily since late December of that year.</p>

	<h3>Yeast</h3>
	<img class="toright" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/starter.jpg" alt="starter">
	<p>I use yeast from a starter (pictured at right).</p>
	<p>Twice a day the yeast gets fed by taking by mixing some starter and equal parts by weight flour and water. For me a good amount is to take 80 grams starter, 80 grams flour, and 80 grams water, with possibly more of the latter two if I am expecting to use it close to the next feeding.</p>
	<p>I use a blend of roughly 1/4 whole barley flour and 3/4 bread flour for feeding. The bread flour can be replaced by all-purpose; the whole barley flour can be substituted for by most any whole grain.
	<p>Between feedings I try to keep the yeast above 70 Fahrenheit - a proofing oven can be useful for this, otherwise the inside of an oven with the light on can do, although this tends to be warmer and uses up the oven.</p>
	<p>Excess starter is discarded at each feeding. It can be used for other sourdough goods, like crackers or waffles.</p>
	<p>Creating the starter is much the same as maintaining it - the first day just doesn't have the 1 part starter in the feeding mixture. It takes close to 2 weeks (and possibly longer) before the yeast starts being effective for baking.</p>

	<h3>Procedure for Bread</h3>
	<p>Baking takes place two days after starting. The sequence on the start day takes roughly 4.5 hours with light attention, baking is roughly an 1.5 hours total.</p>
	<p>My target mass for a loaf is around 480 g (slightly over 1 pound). With the tools I have this ideally comes from a loaf that is roughly 22 cm by 16 cm (rounded ends) with a height around 9 cm.</p>
	<h4>Mixing</h4>
	<p>One loaf at the desired size takes 320 g flour, 235 g water, 2 tablespoons starter, and a little under 1 tsp salt. I use a blend of 3/8 all-purpose flour and 5/8 bread flour. Bread flour is higher in protein which leads to more structure at the expense of texture - the bread is less soft.</p>
	<p>Start by mixing the flour and the water and let that rest for 50-60 minutes. After that, mix in the starter and salt - the dough should become difficult to mix fairly quickly after starting to do this, but try to distribute the starter as well as possible while still being gentle.<br>From here, cover the bowl being used with a damp towel and try to place in an environment about 31 degrees Celsius (roughly 88 F) for its bulk rise. A warmer enviorment at this stage leads to more flavor in the bread, though having it too warm can lead to structural problems.</p>
	<h4>Working</h4>
	<p>In the early parts of the bulk rise, structure is added to the dough through a series of stretching the dough and folding it over itself in-bowl. This can be done by wetting the fingers (to prevent sticking) and grabbing one side of the dough, drawing it up to stretch, and then folding it over itself. This is repeated from 4-6 sides.</p>
	<p>These stretch and fold sequences happen at increasing intervals. I do the first after 10 minutes, the second 15 minutes after that, the third 20 minutes after that, and so on until the sixth. After the 6th, I let it go 45 minutes until roughly 3 hours total have elapsed.</p>
	<p>Once the bulk rise has completed after roughly 3 hours, bring the dough out onto a board for preshaping. This means sliding a thin flat tool (with water on it to not stick) around the side of the dough and pushing it under itself to form roughly a circle, being sure to move it on the board while doing so. From here, leave the preshaped dough on the board to rest.</p>
	<p>After about 30 minutes, it is time to shape. Flour a cloth to place inside a basket, and the excess flour on the board away from the dough. Pick up the dough using the flat tool from the previous step and place it upside-down on the flour. Shape by folding two opposite sides in, then rolling it up perpendicular to those folds, placing it in the basket with the seam parallel to the longer sides.</p>
	<p>Place the basket with dough into a refrigerator. It should stay there at least 12 hours, but ideally longer for stronger flavor and possibly more structure. I typically end up refrigerating for around 44 hours.</p>
	<h4>Baking</h4>
	<p>For baking, I preheat my oven to 525 Fahrenheit (274 C) - ideal temperature likely varies significantly across ovens and cooking vessels used. For good crust, baking should start in a vessel that can hold in steam and withstand the high oven temperatures, such as a Dutch oven. I also place a baking stone on the bottom shelf to prevent direct heat from reaching the bottom of the vessel as to not burn the bottom of the bread. </p>
	<p>Once the oven has heated, prepare a piece of parchment paper with a thin layer of flour over an area roughly the size of the basket used for proofing. Empty the dough from the basket onto that flour by inverting the basket - the dough should fall off the cloth cleanly. Place a little flour on top of the dough, then score (make cuts in) the top as desired. I usually make 2 overlapping cuts running roughly 2/3 the length down the middle.<br>Now the dough is movable via the parchment paper - lower it into the vessel, cover, and place in the oven.</p>
	<p>After 20 minutes or a bit more, remove the cover and slightly after that after reclosing the oven, lower the temperature of the oven (for me to 450 F (232 C)).<br>About 20 minutes after this, move the bread out of the vessel and onto a cool pan (I use an airbake) and place back in the oven.<br>About 20 minutes after that, the bread will be finished. Some ovens bake unevenly front-to-back - if this is the case, it may be worth rotating the pan halfway through on this last step.</p>
	<p>The bread needs to cool some (at least an hour, longer better) before cutting to finish baking. Before cooled, the inside will be gummy and most of the taste sensation will be that it is warm. This is actually a good thing for mediocre bread, but good bread will still be good when cooled.</p>
